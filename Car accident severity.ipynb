Large data files of Police accident reports and Transport Accident Commission claims from accidents in Victoria during the 1980's were obtained and merged. Four methods of analysis to meet the objective were developed and applied to the data to address one or more key problem areas. Target groups for countermeasures were identified and, where possible, accident and injury mechanisms were suggested, and countermeasures to address these mechanisms were proposed.\n\nVolume 1 covers the specific objectives, concepts, data, methods, conclusions and recommendations of the project, as well as the Executive Summaries of the analysis reports. The full analysis reports are given in Volume 2. The conclusions recommend that new surveys of the on-road exposure of drivers, passengers, motorcyclists and pedestrians be conducted in Victoria. It is also recommended that clustering methods be applied to other key road trauma problem areas as a matter of priority, as these methods are able to identify new target groups which are currently hidden."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "###  Problem Description:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions. This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990. About 68,000 of these occurred in children less than five years old. Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions. Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles. While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants)\nThe safety performance of roadways is almost always reported as a rate. That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm. Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.\n\nCommon rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled. Simple counts are almost never used. The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.\n\nThere is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense. The rate to be selected depends on the question being asked \u2013 and often also on what data are available. What is important is to specify exactly what rate is measured and how it relates to the problem being addressed. Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled. Others combine rates. The U.S. state of Iowa, for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity)\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Target Audience:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "While the previous strategy set a target for fatalities only, this strategy gives greater attention to the serious injury dimension of the road trauma problem. There is currently no reliable national collection of serious injury crash data, largely because of jurisdictional differences in injury definitions and reporting arrangements. As a matter of priority, road transport agencies are working towards the adoption of nationally consistent road crash classification definitions and an improved national serious injury database. This will be essential for effective monitoring of progress towards the serious injury target."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
